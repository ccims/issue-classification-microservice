Closed as not a bug, with comments that seem to indicate multiple text fields are a problem, but multiple checkboxes are okay.\r\n\r\n[[FormControl] Maximum update depth exceeded](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/12197). Closed with comment `You can only use a single input within a FormControl.` \r\n\r\n## Current Behavior üòØ\r\n\r\nThe example in the Checkbox documentation contradicts the documented API, by placing 3 checkboxes inside one FormControl\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior ü§î\r\n\r\nPossible fix 1:\r\nThe FormControl does not contain the text `Only one input can be used within a FormControl.` If there are cases where it's okay to use multiple inputs, and other cases where it doesn't work, the FormControl documents those. Seems like it may be okay to use multiple inputs but not multiple **text** inputs.\r\n\r\nOr, option 2:\r\nThe Checkbox and Radio Button documentation sections do not show, in their demo code, examples of multiple inputs being used inside a FormControl.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce üïπ\r\n\r\n1. Visit the docs page for FormControl. https://material-ui.com/api/form-control/ Note the text, with an adjacent yellow Warning icon, `‚ö†Ô∏èOnly one input can be used within a FormControl.`\r\n2. Visit the docs page for Checkbox, and scroll to the section \"Checkboxes with FormGroup.\" https://material-ui.com/components/checkboxes/#checkboxes-with-formgroup\r\n3. Click the <> button to show the source.\r\n4. Scroll down in the source code to see the usage of `FormControl`. Note that inside each FormControl is a FormGroup containing three Checkbox inputs.\r\n\r\n## Context üî¶\r\nI'm trying to figure out how FormControl fits in with Material-UI forms components.

This is normally required when dealing with CSP.\r\n```\r\n([source](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/advanced-configuration/))\r\n\r\n## Examples üåà\r\n\r\nWhen the `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false` flag is not set, a user is liable to receive the following error: \r\n\r\n```\r\nRefused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"script-src 'self' static.zdassets.com www.googletagmanager.com www.google.com www.gstatic.com\". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-mB4hl8euSw00eXDUIRf8KeqpMfBXgg0FILGScPTo+n0='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.\r\n```\r\nWhen adding the specified hash to the Content Security Policy, the application works, but if deployed again, the hash changes and the Content Security Policy needs to be updated with the new hash. This is not feasible in the long term.\r\n\r\n## Motivation üî¶\r\nAdding CSP to a CSR app should be relatively straightforward using the `INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false` flag. By making mention of it in the docs, it will hopefully cut down the time needed to troubleshoot.\r\n"},{"labels":["documentation",null],"text":"Your documentation and examples recommend Roboto font.

If it's safe to assume that this is a logical DOM order for most users, and it doesn't affect the visual layout, then that seems like a reasonable solution. \r\n\r\nBut I was hoping to have full props access to the `<span>{displayValue}</span>` node, so I could find another solution like hiding it from assistive technology using `aria-hidden` and moving the equivalent of `displayValue` to the accessible icon title. It's a little annoying that we'd have to recreate the logic of `displayValue`, but I could live with that.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"206\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-04 at 6 04 41 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7654254/89349902-01f04100-d67d-11ea-9783-63c929d0822c.png\">\r\n\r\n**Demo**: https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-3ghl7?file=/demo.js\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst notificationsCount = 1000\r\nconst max = 99;\r\nconst displayValue = notificationsCount > max ? `${max}+` : notificationsCount;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/notifications\">\r\n  <Badge\r\n    badgeContent={notificationsCount}\r\n    color=\"primary\"\r\n    displayValueProps={{ \"aria-hidden\": true }}\r\n  >\r\n    <MailIcon titleAccess={`${displayValue} notifications`} />\r\n  </Badge>\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that's not part of [the `<Badge>` API](https://material-ui.com/api/badge/), so that's not possible. And using the `classes` prop won't help here, either, since there's no CSS that will hide a node from assistive technology and preserve it visually, only the opposite (e.g. `display: none`). So the resulting accessible label is \r\n\r\n> 99+ notifications 99+\r\n\r\n<img width=\"206\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-04 at 6 04 41 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7654254/89350413-fb15fe00-d67d-11ea-8c10-c24aeac38ed4.png\">\r\n\r\nThe next option I tried was wrapping the `badgeContent` in an `aria-hidden` node directly, but that breaks some more default functionality, like passing in my own `displayValue` and specifiying that it should be hidden when the count is `0`. If it were possible for the `<Badge>` component to read `children` as [the equivalent of `innerText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) and then parse it as an integer, then `<span aria-hidden>8</span>` could still be parsed as the number `8` instead of a string or a component, etc.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"181\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-04 at 6 19 10 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7654254/89350997-17666a80-d67f-11ea-9d98-c3faaf3fe73b.png\">\r\n\r\n**Demo**: https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-fxbpy?file=/demo.js\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst notificationsCount = 1000\r\nconst max = 99;\r\nconst displayValue = notificationsCount > max ? `${max}+` : notificationsCount;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/notifications\">\r\n  <Badge\r\n    badgeContent={<span aria-hidden>{displayValue}</span>}\r\n    color=\"primary\"\r\n    invisible={notificationsCount === 0}\r\n  >\r\n    <MailIcon titleAccess={`${displayValue} notifications`} />\r\n  </Badge>\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, it all works! But it seems unnecessarily painful to get there. \r\n\r\nI recognize there are other options, still, like \r\n\r\n**Demo**: https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-ycehq?file=/demo.js\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst notificationsCount = 1000\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/notifications\">\r\n  <Badge badgeContent={notificationsCount} color=\"primary\">\r\n    <MailIcon />\r\n  </Badge>\r\n  <span className=\"visually-hidden\">notifications</span>\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut either changing the default DOM order of the two nodes or providing props access to the `displayValue` both seem like reasonable enhancements, as well. \r\n\r\n## Motivation üî¶\r\n\r\nI'd love to leverage of all the great existing logic and UI built into `<Badge>`, instead of re-writing big chunks of it to accomodate an accessible label.

Within material-ui some of these styles/overwrites affect another as e.g. Typography is part of more or less any other material-ui component. So adjusting typography might adjust tabs without you noticing. In our current workflow we have one relatively gigantic storybook showcasing all the components we have (including a re-export of basically all material-ui components).\r\n\r\nI think it might be a good idea to create a \"template\" as part of material-ui to get new component libraries started more quickly & to share themed variants with no-code designers.

However, a number of Material-UI components make use of inline style attributes (e.g. Tabs - https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/packages/material-ui/src/Tabs/Tabs.js#L433). These require the 'unsafe-inline' source (or a hash for each style although this isn't practical). The 'unsafe-inline' source is ignored if a hash or nonce source is set, thus necessitating the removal of the nonce.\r\n\r\nSo generally for Material-UI as I see it, I think one of two things are needed:\r\n1.  Update the CSP documentation for a setup to allow inline style attribute setting (not a great CSP, but would make Material-UIs stance clear on styling then).\r\n2. Set a standard of no inline style attribute setting and we fix them all as bugs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I did an issue search and found this (https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/13364) suggesting that Material-UI as a whole allows inline style attributes and thus are happy with necessitating a non strict CSP setting.

This is a big waste of time\r\n\r\nIf you provide such base codesandboxes, people will be much more inclined to attach repros to their bug reports, but also (and this is the more important), will be much more inclined to submit the bugs they encounter.\r\n"},{"labels":[null,"documentation",null],"text":"<!-- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Thank you very much for contributing to Material-UI by creating an issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è\r\n  To avoid duplicate issues we ask you to check off the following list.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The issue is present in the latest release.\r\n- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior üòØ\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe what happens instead of the expected behavior. -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43670376/72603270-61754200-3921-11ea-82e0-00d54e271e1a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior ü§î\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe what should happen. -->\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce üïπ\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Provide a link to a live example (you can use codesandbox.io) and an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n  Include code to reproduce, if relevant (which it most likely is).\r\n\r\n  This codesandbox.io template _may_ be a good starting point:\r\n  https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app\r\n\r\n  If you're using typescript a better starting point would be\r\n  https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript\r\n\r\n  If YOU DO NOT take time to provide a codesandbox.io reproduction, should the COMMUNITY take time to help you?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1.

Delegating to a root element wrapped by the main component. Any props not recognized by the main component will be passed down to this root element. Example: `Menu` wraps `Popover` which in turn wraps `Modal`.\r\n2. Delegating to components other than the root element. Props are generally passed to these components via a prop on the main component with a name of `<InnerComponentName>Props`. Example: `Select` leverages `Menu` and receives props for the `Menu` element via its `MenuProps` prop.\r\n\r\nIt is the first case (delegation to a root element) for which I think the documentation could be considerably improved.\r\n\r\nCurrently the documentation forces you to follow links to these other components in order to discover the full set of props that a component supports. Many people, especially new users of the library, do not notice (or fully understand) the \"Any other props supplied will be provided to the root element\" portion and miss the fact that many more props may be supported by the component. I think it would be much better for users of the documentation if all of the props from \"inherited\" components were included directly. So in the case of `Menu`, the props for `Popover` and `Modal` would be included directly in the `Menu` documentation. It seems like it should be doable for [buildApi.js](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/docs/scripts/buildApi.js) and [generateMarkdown.js](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/docs/src/modules/utils/generateMarkdown.js) to be enhanced to automatically include the comprehensive props.\r\n\r\n## Examples üåà\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Provide a link to the Material design specification, other implementations,\r\n  or screenshots of the expected behavior.\r\n-->\r\n[This StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58781285/for-material-ui-how-can-i-know-what-the-properties-of-each-components-are) shows one example of users assuming that a component ([AppBar](https://material-ui.com/api/app-bar/) in this case) only supports the properties shown directly on its API page.\r\n\r\n## Motivation üî¶\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What are you trying to accomplish? How has the lack of this feature affected you?\r\n  Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world.\r\n-->\r\nI understand that the current way of documenting the properties was an easier approach to implement, but given the place of \"Better documentation\" within the [roadmap priorities](https://material-ui.com/discover-more/roadmap/#priorities), I think it would be worth the additional complexity in the API doc generation (which is already aware of the inherited component) to allow users to find the comprehensive props more easily/quickly."},{"labels":[null,null,"documentation"],"text":"<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] The issue is present in the latest release.

(https://material-ui.com/guides/typescript/)\r\nBy using the method in your doc, we could override classes in child components, creating highly customizable base components.\r\n\r\nIt would go like this in the parent component:\r\n```\r\n<ComponentName classes{{root: classes.overrideBGWithBlack}} />\r\n```\r\nAnd the child component would be written like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport { withStyles, WithStyles, createStyles, Theme } from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nconst styles = (theme: Theme) => createStyles({\r\n    root: {\r\n        background: 'red'\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\ninterface Properties extends WithStyles<typeof styles> {\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ComponentName extends React.PureComponent<Properties> {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { \r\n        classes,\r\n        name \r\n    } = this.props;\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className={classes.root}>      \r\n        My name is {name}\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(styles)(ComponentName);\r\n```\r\nSo i'm trying to do the same in the new child component using useStyles but i am struggeling with finding the right interface to use to expose the classnames.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport { makeStyles, createStyles, Theme, WithStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\n\r\n                                        // TYPE INCOMPATIBILITY HERE\r\ninterface Properties extends WithStyles<typeof useStyles> {\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\nconst useStyles = makeStyles((theme: Theme) =>\r\n  createStyles({\r\n    root: {\r\n      background: 'red'\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default function ComponentName(props: Properties): JSX.Element {\r\n  const classes = useStyles(props);\r\n  \r\n  const {\r\n    name\r\n  } = props;\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={classes.root}>      \r\n      My name is {name}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it would be great if there is documentation on how expose the classnames with the useStyles."},{"labels":[null,"documentation",null,null],"text":"<!-- Provide a general summary of the feature in the Title above -->\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could add possibility to have multiple header rows\r\n\r\n<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Summary üí°\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how it should work. -->\r\n\r\nThe output table should have multiple header rows, it should look something like this: \r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5377501/38248563-731cf9f4-3751-11e8-9c7d-1486c640fb3d.png)\r\n\r\n## Motivation üî¶\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What are you trying to accomplish?

You must include this header regardless of whether or not SSR is used.\r\n>\r\n> `<meta property=\"csp-nonce\" content={nonce} />`\r\n\r\nThis is not particularly clear to me; the \"you must pass this nonce to JSS\".  How exactly does this happen?  Is the idea that our `page.html` should include this `meta` property in the head?   Like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<head>\r\n<meta property=\"csp-nonce\" content=\"123354-i-am-a-nonce\" />\r\n</head>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that JSS looks for a `csp-nonce` meta property by default? \r\n\r\ni.e. There's no need to write a line of code that says \"hey JSS, this is the nonce you need\", rather that JSS will by convention look for the `csp-nonce` meta property in your `html>head` when it boots and use the value as a nonce if it is found.\r\n\r\nOr am I totally barking up the wrong tree?  Totally possible!\r\n\r\nIt's worth saying that the JSS docs are similarly somewhat ambiguous: https://cssinjs.org/csp/?v=v10.0.0\r\n\r\nFinally I'm wondering whether it's worth mentioning approaches around hashing in the docs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slackhq/csp-html-webpack-plugin\r\n\r\nI don't know enough around this topic to say though."},{"labels":["documentation",null],"text":"<!-- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Thank you very much for contributing to Material-UI by creating an issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è\r\n  To avoid duplicate issues we ask you to check off the following list.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x ] The issue is present in the latest release.\r\n- [ x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior üòØ\r\nUsing the create-react-app example:\r\n1) Download the example or clone the repo\r\n2) npm install\r\n3) npm start\r\n\r\nnpm start throws the following error in Windows 10: \r\n> create-react-app@4.0.0 start C:\\Users\\janit\\Desktop\\create-react-app\r\n> SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true react-scripts start\r\n\r\n'SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe what happens instead of the expected behavior. -->\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior ü§î\r\nnpm starts the react app\r\n<!-- Describe what should happen. -->\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce üïπ\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Provide a link to a live example (you can use codesandbox.io) and an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n  Include code to reproduce, if relevant (which it most likely is).\r\n\r\n  This codesandbox.io template _may_ be a good starting point:\r\n  https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app\r\n\r\n  If you're using typescript a better starting point would be\r\n  https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript\r\n\r\n  If YOU DO NOT take time to provide a codesandbox.io reproduction, should the COMMUNITY take time to help you?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n(On Windows 10)\r\nUsing the create-react-app example:\r\n1.

When declaring the props interface for a given component, the current recommendation in the docs (https://material-ui.com/guides/typescript/#usage-of-withstyles) is: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { WithStyles, createStyles } from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nconst styles = (theme: Theme) => createStyles({\r\n  root: { /* ... */ },\r\n  paper: { /* ... */ },\r\n  button: { /* ... */ },\r\n});\r\n\r\ninterface Props extends WithStyles<typeof styles> {\r\n  foo: number;\r\n  bar: boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this creates a bit of an issue if you export the `Props` interface to be used by other modules. For example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst foo: Props = {\r\n  foo: 42,\r\n  bar: true,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'classes' is missing in type '{ foo: number; bar: true; }' but required in type 'Props'.ts(2741)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand the reasoning for wanting it to be a required property from the internal component perspective so that the component knows it will always have a `classes` prop provided, but from an external component API perspective it makes it quite clunky to use. For example if i had another component and followed a typical MUI convention:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface OtherProps {\r\n\tChildComponentProps?: Props;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit would require the consumer to provide a `classes` property if they specified the `ChildComponentProps` prop.\r\n\r\nWe've worked around this in our applications by creating a new type called `WithStylesPublic` that is a copy of `WithStyles` but makes the `classes` property optional. Then we use it like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Props extends WithStylesPublic<typeof styles> {\r\n  foo: number;\r\n  bar: boolean;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Component: React.FC<Props & WithStyles<typeof styles>> = ({ classes, ...other }) => { ... }); \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior ü§î\r\n\r\nNot sure on the best solution here. Should MUI provide an interface similar to what i've described with `WithStylesPublic` that has classes optional? Should this just be documentation? If so it leaves the burden on the developer to work around this case.\r\n\r\n## Context üî¶\r\n\r\nWe have had great success creating an internal component library that wraps the MUI components and re-exports them. In some cases we like to add additional functionality to those components such as new props, but in those cases we run into the issues described above.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment üåé\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Include as many relevant details about the environment with which you experienced the bug.\r\n  If you encounter issues with typescript please include version and tsconfig.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n| Tech        | Version |\r\n| ----------- | ------- |\r\n| Material-UI | v4.4.2  |\r\n| React       |         |\r\n| Browser     |         |\r\n| TypeScript  |    v3.6.2     |\r\n| etc.        |         |\r\n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"* google.com: [\"material-ui.com icons\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=material-ui.com+icons&oq=material-ui.com+icons&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l2j69i60l3.3300j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) includes english, frensh and german in the top 3 results\r\n* duckduckgo.com [\"material-ui.com icons\"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=material-ui.com+icons&t=h_&ia=web) does not list any other languages\r\n\r\nSince those languages are only not-ssr for a couple of days (as a result of #17249) duckduckgo might not have caught up already.\r\n\r\nI have some ideas that should improve the build times.

I think it's very intuitive. I could easily compose them into new components. But Material-UI's doc only has a gigantic example which includes everything, I don't even know each prop's meaning, how could I understand the features when they are combined. I think most of time we won't need the same example as that in docs. When we copy the example, we even need to delete most of the example code.

Ideally we would just refactor the links to point to the new urls, but all our documentation is versioned by npm package version, and going back through all the old documentation builds to refactor the urls per npm version would be quite a difficult task. Whereas, I can imagine setting up a redirect might not be quite so difficult? What's in it for Material-UI? It would mean you would make Google happy.

Recently I upgraded a project from MUIv3 to MUIv4, and one of our e2e tests(cypress) started failing.

React number format uses a combination of componetDidUpdate and internal state to track the formatted value. it also, given the right conditions, emits the onValueChange if the props value does not match the state. The render loop happens due to FormControl context updating fill at the same time that react-number-format is waiting for its setState callback to fire. Once the setState callback fires react-number-format thinks the value reverted back to the previous value and emits another onChange.\r\n\r\nRender/Update logs:\r\n```\r\nnumber_format.js:921 number_format ENQUEUE STATE VALUE $1\r\nnumber_format.js:1166 number_format propsValue \r\nnumber_format.js:1167 number_format stateValue $1\r\nnumber_format.js:214 number_format DIDUPDATE-prevPropsValue \r\nnumber_format.js:215 number_format DIDUPDATE-currentPropsValue \r\nnumber_format.js:928 number_format STATE CALLBACK VALUE $1\r\nFormattedInputs.js:49 NUMBERFORMATCUSTOM changeValue 1\r\nFormattedInputs.js:81 DEMO value 1\r\nTextField.js:16 TEXTFIELD value 1\r\nFormControl.js:168 FormControl context {... filled: false, ‚Ä¶}\r\nInputBase.js:190 INPUTBASE value 1\r\nFormattedInputs.js:43 NUMBERFORMATCUSTOM value 1\r\nnumber_format.js:1166 number_format propsValue 1\r\nnumber_format.js:1167 number_format stateValue $1\r\nnumber_format.js:214 number_format DIDUPDATE-prevPropsValue \r\nnumber_format.js:215 number_format DIDUPDATE-currentPropsValue 1\r\nnumber_format.js:921 number_format ENQUEUE STATE VALUE $12\r\nFormControl.js:11 FORMCONTROL handleDirty\r\nFormControl.js:11 FORMCONTROL handleDirtyIsFilled\r\nFormControl.js:168 FormControl context {... filled: true, ‚Ä¶}\r\nInputBase.js:190 INPUTBASE value 1\r\nFormattedInputs.js:43 NUMBERFORMATCUSTOM value 1\r\nnumber_format.js:1166 number_format propsValue 1\r\nnumber_format.js:1167 number_format stateValue $12\r\nnumber_format.js:214 number_format DIDUPDATE-prevPropsValue 1\r\nnumber_format.js:215 number_format DIDUPDATE-currentPropsValue 1\r\nnumber_format.js:921 number_format ENQUEUE STATE VALUE $1\r\nnumber_format.js:928 number_format STATE CALLBACK VALUE $12\r\nFormattedInputs.js:49 NUMBERFORMATCUSTOM changeValue 12\r\nFormControl.js:11 FORMCONTROL handleDirty\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce üïπ\r\n1. Navigate to https://material-ui.com/components/text-fields/#formatted-inputs\r\n2. Clear the react-number-format input (the currency input)\r\n3. Mash 2+ number keys quickly.\r\n4. The docs should crash.\r\n\r\nMinimal Codesandbox without MUI (mimics the FormControl context update)\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-number-minimal-bjfn3\r\nAs a side note using `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` for the dirty check fixes the issue (removes the extra render).\r\n\r\nMinimal Codesandbox with MUI\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-number-format-phone-number-z1950\r\n\r\n## Context üî¶\r\nWe are using react-number-format for phone and currency inputs. While the issue for the most part an edge case (who really types that fast) it could cause some serious issues. I largely believe the issue lies with how react-number-format tracks state internally and fires updates, but this did work in MUIv3 and the current demo is broken.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment üåé\r\n\r\n| Tech         | Version |\r\n|--------------|---------|\r\n| Material-UI  | v4.1.3  |\r\n| React        |  v16.8.6       |\r\n| Browser      |     Chrome    |\r\n| react-number-format |  v4.0.8 |"},{"labels":["documentation",null],"text":"On the homepage (https://material-ui.com) under *Installation*, the suggestion is to install `@next`.

And not show the change made to the array.\r\n\r\nUnder **class**ic React, a way to solve this would be to use [`forceUpdate()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#forceupdate). Except the example given uses hooks. Therefore we must use a workaround, as detailed in the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-forceupdate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7355538/58996888-fd6a9700-87f1-11e9-939d-e5a8f4766998.png)\r\n\r\nSo here is a [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-j38l1?fontsize=14) with the solution implemented and working.\r\nExcept this is a messy, hacky solution, which the React docs also mention. So it seems a little unsuitable for a basic usage example. Which is the reason I have created an Issue, and not a Pull Request.\r\n\r\nSo instead, would there be a proper way to fix this?

The goal of this issue is to find a definition and apply that to every core component to reduce [surprising API behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).\r\n\r\n## Definition\r\n### root = outermost\r\nIf we take the rendered output from a component one could argue that the \"root\" is the top element e.g.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Component() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <RootElement>\r\n      <NotARootElement>\r\n        <NotARootElementEither />\r\n      </NotARootElement>\r\n    </RootElement>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThis would not apply to many components currently ([Popper](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/2dedcc12fda827a9bbb0bece2f94aa0695e73a7c/packages/material-ui/src/Popper/Popper.js#L174), [TableHead](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/23549d4edee4d418c72685489de7e9ab4380e9f2/packages/material-ui/src/TableHead/TableHead.js#L22) etc.). In general this definition wouldn't be very useful since every component introduced that wouldn't even change the behavior would be a breaking change (e.g. `Context.Provider`, `StrictMode`, `Fragment`, `EventListener`).\r\n\r\n### root = outermost host\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Component() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <NotARootElement>\r\n      <div data-is-root={true}>\r\n        <NotARootElementEither />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </NotARootElement>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost of the components would currently be covered by defining the \"root element\" as the outermost element that renders a [host element](https://reactjs.org/docs/implementation-notes.html#mounting-host-elements).\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\nIt is not obvious by looking at the implementation what the root is. Maintainers might know this but without any context we don't know what components render host elements. If we look at the example it is not obvious if `NotARootElement` is rendering a host element or not (see our transition components).\r\n\r\nThis definition would break when portaling or when we add wrapper containers for styling purposes. \r\n\r\nIt is also not very useful for testing. Let's say we define that the `ListItem` is the root element of a `MenuItem`. We want to test that props for the `ListItem` are actually spread to it but the definition provides no selector to find the `ListItem` and check if every prop is there. What we would find is an `li` host element and that shouldn't have any props for the `ListItem` at that point.\r\n\r\n### root = defined per component\r\nThe root element would be what we define via `@inheritComponent`. The definition would add the following constraints to the component:\r\n1. The root element has the `root` class\r\n2. Excess props are spread to this element\r\n3. The root element has the type of `inheritComponent`\r\n4. [ ] The ref is forwarded to the root element (unclear if this adds value)\r\n5. [ ] The root element renders the outermost host element (undecided\r\n\r\n#### remarks\r\n##### about 4.\r\nFor measuring it would make sense to apply the ref to the outermost host. Can be mitigated by exposing an additional ref prop that is applied to the outermost host\r\n\r\n## about \"host *element*\"\r\n\r\nIt might be ok to use it in the following context: \"Excess props are spread to the root element\". However, saying that \"Paper is the root element\" is technically not correct. \"Paper would be the root **component**\" (or element type; but that's an uncommon term). \"`<Paper />` would be an actual root element\".

It diverges from non-Typescript usage, and the solution I found in an issue about overriding `ListItem` with `Link` doesn't currently work.  I almost settled for using `any`, but dug some more and found that there's an open PR out to solve this: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/13868\r\n\r\nIt'd be great if we could document it right now to let people know it's a bit of a dead end, but there's a fix waiting to be released.  Then we could update it when it goes live.  \r\n\r\nI'll see if I can draft it up.\r\n\r\n**Background context:**\r\nThe `component` override prop on components like `ListItem` and `Button` doesn't play well with Typescript.  The regular docs say you can do `<ListItem component={Link}>`.  With Typescript, you instead need to do something along the lines of `<ListItem component={({innerRef, ...props}: ListItemProps) => <Link {...props}/>}>`\r\n\r\nThis actually still doesn't work, because the signatures of the event handler callbacks that `ListItem` passes to `component` are incompatible.  You'll get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypes of property 'onClickCapture' are incompatible.\r\n    Type '((event: MouseEvent<HTMLElement, MouseEvent>) => void) | undefined' is not assignable to type '((event: MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement>) => void) | undefined'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a PR (https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/13868) open currently to solve this by allowing you to provide the component type as a generic parameter:\r\n\r\n`<ListItem<'a'> component={({innerRef, ...props}: ListItemProps) => <Link {...props}/>} button={true}>`\r\n\r\n"},{"labels":[null,"documentation",null],"text":"## Expected Behavior ü§î\r\n'title' property of Tooltip to be of a node type according to https://material-ui.com/api/tooltip/ \r\n\r\n## Current Behavior üòØ\r\n'title' property of Tooltip is of a string type because title prop of the Tooltip is just simply moved to be  a title attribute of html element which is a String.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce üïπ\r\njust look at the Elements tab of a chrome dev tools.

So I had changed the order of the children, not thinking that just changing the order would affect the behavior of `ListItem`.\r\n\r\nLong-term, the best solution would be to improve the implementation so secondary actions are not so fragile. But I understand there may be other priorities right now.\r\n\r\nOne possibility to explore for a future API is to have the secondary action passed in via a `secondaryActionComponent` prop. Then the `ListItem` would always know whether a secondary action existed and could wrap it within a `ListItemSecondaryAction` internally.\r\n"},{"labels":[null,"documentation",null],"text":"<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Thank you very much for contributing to Material-UI by creating an issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è\r\n    To avoid duplicate issues we ask you to check off the following list.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n- [x] This is not a v0.x issue. <!-- (v0.x is no longer maintained) -->\r\n- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior ü§î\r\nNothing\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior üòØ\r\n`InputBase.js:308 Uncaught TypeError: _this.inputRef.focus is not a function`\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce üïπ\r\n\r\nLink: https://codesandbox.io/s/w25j5vo7m5\r\n\r\n1.

I found that `@material-ui/core/es/styles/colorManipulator.js` offers the smallest bundle size of all options I could find. Here's a comparison to other libraries (all numbers are minified; second number is minified + gzipped):\r\n\r\n- colorManipulator.js // 3.02kb, 1.25 gzipped\r\n- [kewler](https://github.com/adriantoine/kewler) // 7.24kb, 2.7kb gzipped\r\n- [spectra](https://github.com/avp/spectra) // 10.5kb, 3.38kb gzipped\r\n- [tinycolor2](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) // 15.2kb, 5.28kb gzipped\r\n- [color](https://github.com/Qix-/color) // 23.1kb, 7.83kb gzipped\r\n- [chroma-js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js/) // 39.8, 15.9kb gzipped\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\n@oliviertassinari has stated that the color manipulator is a [private API](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/10789#issuecomment-375892148). He also openly asked if there were better open-source alternatives to the private implementation. In my view, there is no better alternative. colorManipulator.js offers basically identical functionality to all of the other libraries, and does it in the fewest amount of bytes.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nColor Manipulation is a very generic problem, this library has the best solution, but it is a private API. I think it could be easily publishable as a separate entity within the mono-repo structure. It's already fully unit tested, so there could be no disagreement that it would be in a good state to make publicly accessible. \r\n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"missing closing tag\r\n\r\nhttps://material-ui.com/utils/popover/\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2733862/46187291-a23fe680-c2eb-11e8-88e2-73af6493aba8.png)\r\n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"- [x] This is not a v0.x issue. <!-- (v0.x is no longer maintained) -->\r\n- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nFilled and outlined should work like it works on TextField with FormControl.

I doubt it has any room in the official Material UI repo, but who knows if it will spark any ideas.\r\n\r\nLink to loader: https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-to-mui-loader\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nBasically, you can do things like this in your CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  --xs-color: blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n  background: $(theme.palette.primary.main);\r\n  padding: 2su; /* Material UI spacing units */\r\n}\r\n \r\n.button:hover {\r\n  background: $(theme.palette.primary.light);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media $(theme.breakpoints.only('xs')) {\r\n  .button {\r\n    background: var(--xs-color);\r\n    -mui-mixins: theme.mixins.button;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and then load it as you would an external JS file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';\r\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\nimport styles from './styles.css';\r\n \r\nconst MyComponent = withStyles(styles)(({ classes }) => (\r\n  <Button className={classes.button}>\r\n    Click Me\r\n  </Button>\r\n));\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder the hood it converts to something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default (theme) => {\r\n  const xsColor = `blue`;\r\n  return {\r\n    button: {\r\n      background: `${theme.palette.primary.main}`,\r\n      padding: `${theme.spacing.unit * 2}px`,\r\n      '&:hover': {\r\n        background: `${theme.palette.primary.light}`,\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    [theme.breakpoints.only('xs')]: {\r\n      button: {\r\n        ...theme.mixins.button,\r\n        background: `${xsColor}`,\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nI hoped to solve the following problems with this loader:\r\n- copy/paste CSS directly from Chrome inspector\r\n- make it easier for designers on the team to not have to work with JS\r\n- reduce verbosity of my style files\r\n- but still leverage the MUI theme and the power of scoped JSS\r\n\r\nAgain, happy to remove or move this issue if it's not helping anything, but also open to suggestions of where else to post this for others who may find it useful."},{"labels":[null,"documentation",null],"text":"<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Thank you very much for contributing to Material-UI by creating an issue! ‚ù§Ô∏è\r\n    To avoid duplicate issues we ask you to check off the following list.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n- [x] This is a v1.x issue. <!-- (v0.x is no longer maintained) -->\r\n- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!---\r\n    Describe what should happen.\r\n-->\r\nWhen you enter an invalid value into `TextField` of `type=\"number\"` the label should stay where it was - above the value.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!---\r\n    Describe what happens instead of the expected behavior.\r\n-->\r\nAfter the input with an invalid value is blurred the label starts overlapping the value.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!---\r\n    Provide a link to a live example (you can use codesandbox.io) and an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug.\r\n    Include code to reproduce, if relevant (which it most likely is).\r\n\r\n    This codesandbox.io template _may_ be a good starting point:\r\n    https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app\r\n\r\n    If you're using typescript a better starting point would be\r\n    https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript\r\n\r\n    If YOU DO NOT take time to provide a codesandbox.io reproduction, should the COMMUNITY take time to help you?\r\n\r\n-->\r\nLink: https://codesandbox.io/s/y0ykr6zo5z\r\n\r\n1.

Changed the webpack.config.js mode from `mode: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',` to `mode: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production',` and ran it.\r\n\r\nComponent.js\r\n``` javascript\r\n/*\r\n * Copyright (c) 2018, Critical Labs LLC\r\n ******************************************************************************/\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\r\n\r\nimport Stepper from '@material-ui/core/Stepper';\r\nimport Step from '@material-ui/core/Step';\r\nimport StepLabel from '@material-ui/core/StepLabel';\r\nimport StepContent from '@material-ui/core/StepContent';\r\n\r\nclass Component extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      activeStep: 0,\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Stepper orientation=\"vertical\" activeStep={this.state.activeStep}>\r\n          <Step>\r\n            <StepLabel>Test</StepLabel>\r\n            <StepContent>Hello World</StepContent>\r\n          </Step>\r\n        </Stepper>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Component;\r\n```\r\n\r\nApp.js\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\r\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\nimport Component from './Component.js';\r\n\r\nconst styles = theme => ({\r\n  root: {\r\n    backgroundColor: '#f00',\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { classes } = this.props;\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className={classes.root}>\r\n        <Component/>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nApp.propTypes = {\r\n  classes: PropTypes.object.isRequired,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(styles)(App);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThis doesn't allow me to use the Stepper component in production. I may try to fallback to the v0 Stepper, as it works fine and I'm running both versions in parallel currently.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment with which you experienced the bug. -->\r\n\r\n| Tech         | Version |\r\n|--------------|---------|\r\nMaterial-UI | 1.4.2\r\nReact version | 16.4.1\r\nChrome version (build) | 67.0.3396.87\r\n"},{"labels":["documentation"],"text":"React material ui document site is down https://material-ui.com/ is down\r\n\r\n- [x ] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n https://material-ui.com/ should load without service worker\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n https://material-ui.com/ is not loading.\r\n"},{"labels":["documentation",null],"text":"Ever since version 2 of `@material-ui/icons` my live reloading is reaaaaaally slow (from less than a second to more than 5 seconds).
