If it would be helpful I can work on other parts of the docs to convert code blocks to use `doctest`. Currently it seems there are over 400 code blocks in the docs using the format `Example::` that are not being tested, e.g. a bunch are in this [file](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/_torch_docs.py). \n\ncc @jlin27 @mruberry @VitalyFedyunin"},
